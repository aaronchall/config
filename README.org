* config
These are notes to myself, but might help others...
(Edit this file with emacs!)

** usage:

For new machine update system.stateVersion and
name the machine a'la x1 (in flake.nix and repo's x1.nix), give it hardware specific config
from auto-generated hardware-configuration.nix and configuration.nix.

~switch_config~ is aliased to something like ~sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/config/#x1~
where ~x1~ is the name of the flake in flake.nix.

Be sure to commit new files so flake can see them.



** TODOS:
*** DONE factor gui.nix
*** TODO add server config
** config:

- flake.nix - top level entry point, has all computers config'd
  - x1 - my laptop, uses the following nix files:
    - x1.nix - everything specific to the machine, stuff like
      - contents of old hardware-configuration.nix
      - keyboard media key mappings with actkbd
      - network device references from old configuration.nix
      - other machine specific configuration like systemd job and experimental services
    - console.nix - everything I would want on any nix console/bash shell
      - networks.nix - private, see demonetworks.nix for example
      - colors.nix - long story, but used in both console and gui
      - prompt.sh - instead of multiline string, allows for syntax highlighting
    - gui.nix - everything I would want on any gui machine, browsers, editors, etc.
      - colors.nix - actually gave a pull request
	with these to kitty: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes/pull/98
    - home.nix - home-manager, dotfile kind of stuff,
      some things are just better handled by home-manager anyways.
      - home console - not broken down into these... yet.
      - home gui - not broken down into...
  - server
    - console.nix
    - home.nix console semantic
** Defunct

- screensharing-hacks.nix - no need to check these out unless you're trying to get screensharing to work with wayland
